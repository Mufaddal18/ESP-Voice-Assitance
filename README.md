# ESP-Voice-Assitance

ðŸš€ Excited to share my latest project: a fully integrated PCB for a voice assistant inspired by Avi Patelâ€™s Gemini Voice Assistant!

This innovative design utilizes the Deepgram API for seamless speech-to-text conversion and leverages the Gemini API for intelligent responses, all while harnessing Google Text-to-Speech for natural-sounding replies.

ðŸ”‘ Key Features:

1. Integrated Components: Powered by the ESP32, featuring a USB to TTL circuit, I2S microphone, and robust amplifier for top-notch performance.

2. Speech-to-Text Conversion: Impressively quick response time with Deepgram API.

3. Smart Audio Switching: Automatically toggles between speaker and earphone output for a personalized listening experience.

4. WAV File Storage: Efficiently processes longer questions by storing them as WAV files on an SD card.

5. Replay Functionality: A dedicated button to replay the last response, enhancing user interaction.
